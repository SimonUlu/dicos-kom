# AngularDic

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.3.

## Development server

Either start the integrated ng dev server by running 

´´´sh
  ng serve
´´´

or start docker-container for development purposes with integrated hot reloading

´´´sh
  docker compose up --build
´´´

note: docker container is not production ready and has to be extended by minimal webserver such as nginx (by only copying the build files)
